/*
  This file is intentionally minimal when using the Tailwind Play CDN.

  The `@tailwind` directives are NOT needed here because the CDN script
  in the index.html file automatically generates all the necessary utility
  classes by scanning the HTML.

  You would only add custom CSS rules here that you cannot or do not want
  to create with Tailwind's utility classes. For this project, no such
  custom rules are needed.
*/

/*
  For example, if you needed a very specific animation that wasn't
  covered by Tailwind utilities, you could add it here:

  .custom-swoop-animation {
      animation: swoop-in 0.5s ease-out forwards;
  }

  @keyframes swoop-in {
      from {
          opacity: 0;
          transform: translateX(-50px);
      }
      to {
          opacity: 1;
          transform: translateX(0);
      }
  }
